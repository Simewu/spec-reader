# Introductory Material

## 1.1 Foreword

This Technical Specification has been produced by the O-RAN Alliance.

The contents of the present document are subject to continuing work within O-RAN and may change following formal O-RAN approval. Should the O-RAN Alliance modify the contents of the present document, it will be re-released by O-RAN with an identifying change of release date and an increase in version number.

## 1.2 Scope

### 1.2.1 General

The present document specifies the interoperability testing (IOT) for the radio access network nodes from different vendors connected using the X2, F1 and Xn interfaces implemented in accordance with the NR C-Plane [2] and U-Plane [3] profiles.

In this version of the specification:

* X2 interoperability testing is focused on the eNB and en-gNB as the Devices under Tests (DUTs)
* F1 interoperability testing is focused on the en-gNB consisting of the gNB-CU and gNB-DU as the DUTs and also the gNB consisting of the same elements
* Xn interoperability testing is focused on the gNBs as the DUTs

In case an SUT component DUT is replaced by a test tool or by a node emulator (see section 2.1.1.1), messages captured at standardised interfaces in the test configuration may be used to check compliance of a DUT against that part of the applicable technical standards exercised by the IOT TCs for that configuration. In such SUT configurations, interoperability between DUTs from different vendors cannot be tested.

### 1.2.2 Applicability to O-RAN interoperability badging procedures

The interoperability between network functions may be tested and verified by various activities between different DUT vendors. The outcome of such activities is documented in a test report and a badge may be awarded, according to the procedures described in [16].

This specification contains test cases that are applicable to one or several network configurations. Network configurations depend on the connected core network type (EPC or 5GC), on the selected radio access technology (LTE and NR) and on the (en-)gNB node architecture, ie, split into (en-)gNB-CU and (en-)gNB-DU or non-split (en-)gNB. Interoperability test activities and resulting reports and badges for the interfaces X2, Xn and F1, respectively, may refer to the below six network configurations:

* NSA (EN-DC), non-split architecture
* NSA (EN-DC), split architecture
* SA, non-split architecture
* SA, split architecture
* SA including NR-DC, non-split architecture
* SA including NR-DC, split architecture

The test cases applicable to one or more network configurations are mandatory to ensure interoperability between DUTs. The mapping table below contains the applicability of test cases to the above mentioned network configurations. Some few test cases which require availability of, for example, specific spectrum resources may be omitted from interoperability test activities.

# Chapter 2 Interoperability Measurements

## 2.1 Interoperability Test Definitions

### 2.1.1 Test Configurations

Interoperability testing is performed to prove that the end-to-end functionality between the radio access network nodes is as per specified in the O-RAN NR C-Plane [2] and U-Plane [3] profiles specifications on which these components are based. This requires system level testing of the radio access network nodes requiring interoperability testing as an integrated system.

Figure 2-1 shows the EN-DC Overall Architecture [2]. The en-gNB may consist of a gNB-CU and one or more gNB-DU(s). A gNB-CU and a gNB-DU is connected via the F1 interface.

#### 2.1.1.1 Device Under Test (DUT) and System Under Test (SUT)

The case where the DUTs for X2, F1 and Xn interoperability tests are provided by different vendors is the focus of this document, but the case where both are from the same vendor is also valid.

Table 2-1 summarizes the DUTs and SUTs for X2, F1 and Xn interoperability testing scenarios.

<div class="table-wrapper" markdown="block">

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| IOT Interface | DUTs | | SUT |
| NE1 | NE2 | NE1, NE2 and interconnecting IOT Interface |
| X2 | eNB | en-gNB | eNB, en-gNB and X2 |
| F1 | gNB-CU | gNB-DU | gNB-CU, gNB-DU and F1 |
| Xn | gNB | gNB | gNB, gNB and Xn |
| NE: Network Element as per defined in [1] | | | |

</div>

**Table 2-1: DUTs and SUTs for X2, F1 and Xn Interoperability Testing**

The test configurations will involve defining the cardinality between the X DUT NE1(s) and Y DUT NE2(s) as part of the test scenario which will determine the configuration required. The simplest test configuration involves a single DUT NE1 and a single DUT NE2 ie, X=Y=1.

Figure 2-3, 2-4 and 2-5 show the SUT configurations for X2, F1 and Xn interoperability testing, respectively.

External physical connections between the X DUT NE1(s) and Y DUT NE2(s) are out of scope of this specification.

#### 2.1.1.2 Testing Tools

One of the key objectives of interoperability testing is to validate the functionality of production grade DUTs. Hence it is important to ensure that the DUTs are not negatively impacted with the utilization of internal functions solely to support interoperability testing, ie, DUTs are not expected to be testing tools when deployed in production networks and therefore DUTs should not be used as testing tools during interoperability tests.

Interoperability tests are performed with a set of testing tools which are used to both apply active stimulus and as well as passive monitoring and measurements of the DUTs.

**Table 2-2: Testing Tools Summary and Applicability to X2, F1 and Xn Interoperability Testing**

##### 2.1.1.2.2 Testing Tools Details

This section describes details of the testing tools listed in Table 2-2.

In any test configuration that illustrates a DU, as an option as noted in Table 2-2, that DU may be substituted by O-DU and O-RU functions. Such substitution has no effect on the 3GPP interfaces that are the sole target of this specification. In all such cases the O-RU function may be performed by real or emulated equipment (No. 8 in Table 2-2). Additionally, where the F1 interface is not the object of the test, both O-DU and O-RU functions may be performed by an emulator (No 7 in Table 2-2).

Given that the objective of this test specification is to validate the interoperability between the radio access network nodes over the X2, F1 and Xn interface and protocols, the test setup can be simplified if there can be alternative means of connecting the Test UEs and/or UE emulator to the DUTs namely the eNB, en-gNB and gNB in the various interoperability test setups. This can be accomplished if the DU or DU emulator is connected via cable to the UE or UE emulator where that DU can optionally be an O-DU and O-RU or respective emulator.

**Active stimulus testing tools**

This paragraph shows details of active stimulus testing tools for X2, F1 and Xn interfaces interoperability testing.

NOTE: The number allocated to each testing tool below corresponds to the number on the list in Table 2-2.

* **No. 1: Test UEs and/or UE emulator**: used to generate stateful UE connections and traffic to validate the DUTs implementation of the X2, F1 and Xn interface protocols as these are stimulated by the 3GPP upper layer protocols:

o Required so that the DUTs do not need to be put into a "test mode" which does not happen in live deployments

o Test UEs and UE emulator will be required to support EN-DC operations for X2 and F1 interoperability testing. Test UEs and UE emulator will be required to support Standalone (SA) mode for Xn interoperability testing

o Test UEs will require SIM cards which are pre-provisioned with subscriber profiles. UEs used for testing can be simpler to setup but given that these Test UEs are designed as commercial UEs with possibly certain diagnostic functions enabled for logging purposes, they are limited in terms of configurability

o UE emulator will require SIM profile configuration with the subscriber's profiles. UE emulator can be used in test scenarios which require multiple UE sessions, more flexibility and configurability to help drive test scenarios

o RF connection between the Test UEs or UE emulator with the DUTs namely the eNB, en-gNB and gNB will be either through cabled connection or Over-The-Air (OTA)

* **No. 2: Core or Core emulator**: used to terminate stateful NAS sessions with Test UEs and/or UE emulator and stateful S1 or NG sessions with the DUTs:

o Required so that the DUTs do not need to be put into a "test mode" which does not happen in live deployments

o Core or Core emulator will be required to support EPC with EN-DC capabilities for X2 and F1 interoperability testing. Core or Core emulator will be required to support 5GC with SA capabilities for Xn and F1 interoperability testing

o External physical connection between Core or Core emulator and eNB, en-gNB and gNB is out of scope of this specification

* **No. 4: Application Test Server**: An endpoint application test traffic emulator which can be used to originate and/or terminate various traffic streams to or from the Test UEs or UE emulator, respectively. It may provide one or more of these options:

o Stateful traffic, eg, TCP, TWAMP

o Stateless traffic, eg, UDP

**Passive monitoring and measurements testing tools**

This paragraph shows details of passive monitoring and measurements testing tools for X2, F1 and Xn interfaces interoperability testing.

NOTE: The number allocated to each testing tool below corresponds to the number on the list in Table 2-2.

* **No. 5: Protocol Analyzer**: used for protocol analysis and measurements of X2 and Xn interfaces C-Plane and U-Plane protocols; S1-U and NG-U interface protocols, and F1 interface C-Plane and U-Plane protocols:

o Test case validation and troubleshooting purposes which can help with test setup validation and root cause analysis for test cases which fail

o Monitoring traffic from the X2, F1, Xn, S1-U and NG-U interfaces typically through a tap or span port. Taps are typically preferred as span ports are less reliable but can be used if taps are not readily available in the test lab. Connectivity specifics (eg, number of 10/25/40/100 GE) is out of scope of this specification

NOTE: If IPsec encryption (non-Null) is applied to the X2, F1, Xn, S1-U and NG-U interfaces, the Protocol Analyzer cannot be used to reliably analyze the procedures and protocols exchanged over these interfaces. Decryption of IPsec protected traffic for lab testing purpose can be possible but processing intensive particularly when dealing with dynamic security parameters

* No.1 and 10 Test UE logging tool and/or UE emulator: used to produce measurements and logs:

o Measurements and KPIs logs for test case validation and reporting

o Diagnostics logs for troubleshooting purposes which can help with test setup validation and root cause analysis for failed test cases

o Diagnostics mode shall be enabled on the Test UEs for diagnostic logging purposes. Device logging tools shall be connected to the Test UEs for logging purposes

o UEs used for testing can be simpler to setup but given that these Test UEs are designed as commercial UEs, they are limited in terms of diagnostic logging capabilities due to limited processing and buffer space

o UE emulator can be used in test scenarios which require extensive diagnostics capabilities

* **No. 9: Test results and KPIs reporting** which can be provided through one or more of these options:

o UE logging tools which are connected to the Test UEs

o UE emulator reporting dashboard typically built in as part of the UE emulator solution

o External dashboard and reporting applications

#### 2.1.1.3 Assumptions

In this version of the specification, the following assumptions apply:

1. **Management Plane** - DUTs are in service and running in normal operating state. M-Plane interactions between the DUTs and Service Management and Orchestration (SMO) are out of scope in this version of the specification.

2. **Synchronization Plane** - all the components including the DUTs and the Testing Tools are required to be synchronized to a common system time and master time source unless otherwise stated. S-Plane test setup details are out of scope in this version of the specification.

3. **Transport Plane** - transport aspects between the DUTs and between the DUTs to the Test Equipment are out of scope in this version of the specification, but the WG5 Transport Specification [6] can be used as a reference. Examples of transport aspects include Physical Connectivity Interface (eg, connectivity rates), Data Link Layer Interface (layer 2 eg, VLAN, QoS marking), Network Layer Interface (layer 3 eg, IP version), (layer 4 eg, SCTP), Security (eg, IPsec).

4. All wireline transport interfaces conform to ideal conditions (no impairments).

5. All wireless connections (air interface) conform to ideal conditions (no impairments) unless otherwise stated in test cases which may have requirements to impair the wireless connections in order to stimulate handover scenarios for example.

6. All wireless connections conform to ideal conditions (no impairments) and adopt 3GPP approaches for "ideal" RF environment test setup.

7. All DUTs comply with the same version or compatible versions of the O-RAN WG5 C-Plane [2] and U-Plane [3] profiles.

8. All elements in the interoperability test and the supporting test environment, where 3GPP support is relevant, comply with the same version or compatible versions of the 3GPP Specifications.

#### 2.1.1.4 Specifications to be used for testing

In this version of the specification, the following sets of specifications and releases/versions shall be supported

* O-RAN WG5:

o NR C-Plane profile [2]

o NR U-Plane profile [3]

* 3GPP

o 3GPP Release and Version as listed in O-RAN WG5 NR C-Plane [2] and U-Plane [3] profiles specifications. It is important to ensure that all DUTs and Testing Tools use compatible release/version of the 3GPP specifications.

#### 2.1.1.5 Standard Test Configuration

Most interoperability tests will use a standard test configuration although individual tests are expected to deviate from this in some way. By defining the standard test configuration, an understanding of how the test setup is configured can be gained, thereafter examining individual tests can reveal the specific deviations from the standard test configuration and these specific deviations will be specified in each of the test cases

1. The standard test setup involves a single DUT NE1 and a single DUT NE2 with DUT NE1 and DUT NE2 as specified in Table 2-1 in accordance with the interoperability test interfaces. Test cases which require more than a single DUT NE1 or DUT NE2 will specify the number of DUT NE1 and DUT NE2 required as part of the test case.

2. IPsec encryption of the interface(s) under test is optional. If IPsec encryption with non-NULL encryption is enabled as part of the test setup, it would not be possible to perform test verification using the Protocol Analyzer without the Protocol Analyzer performing IPsec decryption. Details about IPsec decryption is out of scope of this specification.

##### 2.2.1.7.4 Procedure

1. Perform data transfer in both directions between the Application Test Server and the Test UE or UE emulator

Note: it is a requirement for this test case to validate that the user plane downlink data forwarding function operates correctly during the Secondary Node Addition (Option 3x) procedure. This involves observing that the user plane data forwarded from the eNB to the en-gNB over the X2 interface during the Secondary Node Addition (Option 3x) procedure can be received successfully by the Test UE or UE emulator without seeing any packet losses.

One of the methods which can be used to stimulate the user plane downlink data forwarding function is to transfer user plane data at data rates which are high enough for the eNB to start buffering user plane downlink data prior to the addition of the en-gNB.

The exact data rate which is required to be generated is not specified but it is recommended that the data rate is high enough to verify the user plane downlink data forwarding function (for example, it could correspond to the maximum Layer 1 Radio data rate in the LTE RAT, which is calculated based on 3GPP TS 36.211 [9] using the RAN parameters used in this test).

2. Perform Secondary Node Addition (Option 3x) procedure

An example of how this procedure can be performed (or triggered) is listed below. The exact method to perform (or trigger) this procedure is out of scope of this specification and is left up to the implementation of the DUT.

a. One of the possible methods can be to make use of programmable attenuators to simulate varying channel conditions between the Test UE or UE emulator and the en-gNB cell. In this specific case, the en-gNB cell can start off with high attenuation applied which is subsequently lowered to a level which can trigger the SgNB Addition Request procedure.

3. Stop data transfer between the Application Test Server and the Test UE or UE emulator

4. Perform data transfer in both directions between the Application Test Server and the Test UE or UE emulator for 10 seconds.

Note: it is a requirement for this test case to validate that the user plane transmission operates correctly during Split Bearer(s) operation in EN-DC Option 3x configuration. This involves observing that the user plane data transferred over the X2 in both directions is successfully received by the Test UE or UE emulator (DL data), or by the Application Test Server (UL data) without seeing any packet losses.

One of the methods which can be used to stimulate the Split Bearer(s) usage of both the LTE and NR RATs is to transfer user plane data at data rates high enough for the en-gNB to start distributing user plane data to the eNB via the X2 interface.

The exact data rate which is required to be generated is not specified but it is recommended that the data rate is high enough to verify the user plane data transmission (for example, it could correspond to the maximum Layer 1 Radio data rate in both the LTE RAT and NR RAT, which is calculated based on 3GPP TS 36.211 [9], 3GPP TS 38.211 [10] and 3GPP TS 38.214 [11] using the RAN parameters used in this test).

5. Observe the Protocol Analyzer S1 and X2 logs and Test UE or UE emulator logs

* Regarding the downlink U-Plane data generated in step 1 and after step 2:

o All U-Plane data recorded in the S1 logs is correctly received by the Test UE or UE emulator via LTE RAT or NR RAT

o All U-Plane data recorded in the X2 logs which are:

o Forwarded to the Test UE or emulated UE from the eNB towards the en-gNB via their corresponding established DL Forwarding GTP Tunnels, is correctly received by the Test UE or emulated UE via the NR RAT

o Transmitted to the Test UE or emulated UE from the en-gNB to the eNB, via the established MeNB DL GTP Tunnels, is correctly received by the Test UE or emulated UE via the LTE RAT

Note: this test verification process does not impose a requirement for the en-gNB to transmit the user plane data which it has received from the eNB (as part of the downlink data forwarding procedure) to the Test UE or emulated UE via the eNB and LTE RAT, but rather it is to verify the correct operation of the transmit operation via the eNB and the LTE RAT when it is used by the en-gNB.

* Regarding the downlink U-Plane data generated in step 4:

o All U-Plane data recorded in the S1 logs is correctly received by the Test UE or UE emulator via LTE RAT or NR RAT

o All U-Plane data recorded in the X2 logs (ie, all U-Plane data transferred from en-gNB to eNB) is correctly received by the Test UE or UE emulator via LTE RAT

* Regarding the uplink U-Plane data generated in step 1 and after step 2 and in step 4:

o All U-Plane data transmitted by the Test UE or UE emulator via LTE RAT or NR RAT is recorded in the S1 logs

o All U-Plane data transmitted by the Test UE or UE emulator via LTE RAT (ie, all U-Plane data to be transferred from eNB to en-gNB) is recorded in the X2 logs

1. Perform data transfer in both directions between the Application Test Server and the Test UE or UE emulator

Note: it is a requirement for this test case to validate that the user plane downlink data forwarding function operates correctly during the Secondary Node Change (MN Initiated, Option 3x) procedure. This involves observing that the user plane data forwarded from the source en-gNB to the eNB and from the eNB to the target en-gNB over the X2 interface during the Secondary Node Change (MN Initiated, Option 3x) procedure can be received successfully by the Test UE or UE emulator without seeing any packet losses.

a. One of the possible methods can be to make use of programmable attenuators to simulate varying channel conditions between the Test UE or UE emulator and the Source en-gNB cell (S-SN) and the Target en-gNB cell (T-SN) simultaneously.

Note: it is a requirement for this test case to validate that the user plane transmission operates correctly during Split Bearer(s) operation in EN-DC Option 3x configuration. This involves observing that the user plane data transferred over the X2 in both directions is successfully received by the Test UE or UE emulator (DL data), or by the Application Test Server (UL data) without seeing any packet losses.

One of the methods which can be used to stimulate the Split Bearer(s) usage of both the LTE and NR RATs is to transfer user plane data at data rates which are high enough for the en-gNB to start distributing user plane data to the eNB via the X2 interface.

The exact data rate which is required to be generated is not specified but it is recommended that the data rate is high enough to verify the user plane data transmission (for example, it could correspond to the maximum Layer 1 Radio data rate in both the LTE RAT and NR RAT, which is calculated based on 3GPP TS 36.211 [9], 3GPP TS 38.211 [10] and 3GPP TS 38.214 [11] using the RAN parameters used in this test).

o All U-Plane data recorded in the X2 logs which are:

o Forwarded to the Test UE or emulated UE from the source en-gNB towards the eNB and from the eNB towards the target en-gNB, via their corresponding established DL Forwarding GTP Tunnels, is correctly received by the Test UE or emulated UE via the NR RAT

o Transmitted to the Test UE or emulated UE from the target en-gNB to the eNB, via the established MeNB DL GTP Tunnels, is correctly received by the Test UE or emulated UE via the LTE RAT

Note: this test verification process does not impose a requirement for the target en-gNB to transmit the user plane data which it has received from the eNB (as part of the downlink data forwarding procedure) to the Test UE or emulated UE via the eNB and LTE RAT, but rather it is to verify the correct operation of the transmit operation via the eNB and the LTE RAT when it is used by the target en-gNB

* DUTs shall apply the parameter condition specified in 5.3.2 of the NR C-Plane profile specification [2]

* Data transfer between the Application Test Server and Test UE or UE emulator is possible (via the LTE and NR RATs)

##### 2.2.1.11.4 Procedure

1. Perform data transfer in both directions between the Application Test Server and the Test UE or UE emulator

Note: it is a requirement for this test case to validate that the user plane downlink data forwarding function operates correctly during the Secondary Node Change (SN Initiated, Option 3x) procedure. This involves observing that the user plane data forwarded from the source en-gNB to the eNB and from the eNB to the target en-gNB over the X2 interface during the Secondary Node Change (SN Initiated, Option 3x) procedure can be received successfully by the Test UE or UE emulator without seeing any packet losses.

One of the methods which can be used to stimulate the user plane downlink data forwarding function is to transfer user plane data at data rates which are high enough for the source en-gNB to start buffering user plane downlink data prior to the change of the en-gNB.

The exact data rate which is required to be generated is not specified but it is recommended that the data rate is high enough to verify the user plane downlink data forwarding function (for example, it could correspond to the maximum Layer 1 Radio data rate in both the LTE RAT and the NR RAT, which is calculated based on 3GPP TS 36.211 [9], 3GPP TS 38.211 [10], 3GPP TS 38.214 [11] using the RAN parameters used in this test).

2. Perform Secondary Node Change Procedure from Source en-gNB cell (S-SN) and Target en-gNB cell (T-SN)

An example of how this procedure can be performed (or triggered) is listed below. The exact method to perform (or trigger) this procedure is out of scope of this specification and is left up to the implementation of the DUT.

a. Move the Test UE or UE emulator from the coverage area of Source en-gNB cell (S-SN) towards Target en-gNB cell (T-SN). One of the possible methods can be to make use of programmable attenuators to simulate varying channel conditions between the Test UE or UE emulator and the Source en-gNB cell (S-SN) and the Target en-gNB cell (T-SN) simultaneously. In this specific case, the Source en-gNB cell (S-SN) can start off with low attenuation applied which is subsequently increased. At the same time, the Target en-gNB cell (T-SN) can start off with high attenuation applied which is subsequently lowered to a level which can trigger the SN change procedure from S-SN to T-TN.

3. Stop data transfer from the Application Test Server to the Test UE or UE emulator

4. Perform data transfer in both directions between the Application Test Server and the Test UE or UE emulator for 10 seconds

Note: it is a requirement for this test case to validate that the user plane transmission operates correctly during Split Bearer(s) operation in EN-DC Option 3x configuration. This involves observing that the user plane data transferred over the X2 in both directions is successfully received by the Test UE or UE emulator (DL data), or by the Application Test Server (UL data) without seeing any packet losses.

One of the methods which can be used to stimulate the Split Bearer(s) usage of both the LTE and NR RATs is to transfer user plane data at data rates which are high enough for the en-gNB to start distributing user plane data to the eNB via the X2 interface.

o Transmitted to the Test UE or emulated UE from the target en-gNB to the eNB, via the established MeNB DL GTP Tunnels, is correctly received by the Test UE or emulated UE via the LTE RAT

Note: this test verification process does not impose a requirement for the target en-gNB to transmit the user plane data which it has received from the eNB (as part of the downlink data forwarding procedure) to the Test UE or emulated UE via the eNB and LTE RAT, but rather it is to verify the correct operation of the transmit operation via the eNB and the LTE RAT when it is used by the target en-gNB.

##### 2.2.1.14.4 Procedure

1. Perform data transfer in both directions between the Application Test Server and the Test UE or UE emulator

It should be noted that this test case does not specify the test data pattern generated by the Application Test Server, but it is recommended that the test data pattern should include some level of randomness (ie, avoiding all zeros).

Note: it is a requirement for this test case to validate that the user plane transmission operates correctly during the PCell change (Intra MN) (MN initiated) procedure.

One of the methods which can be used to stimulate the Split Bearer(s) usage of both the LTE and NR RATs is to transfer user plane data at data rates which are high enough for the en-gNB to start distributing user plane data to the eNB via the X2 interface.

The exact data rate which is required to be generated is not specified but it is recommended that the data rate is high enough to verify the user plane data transmission function (for example, it could correspond to the maximum Layer 1 Radio data rate in the LTE RAT, which is calculated based on 3GPP TS 36.211 [9] using the RAN parameters used in this test).

2. Perform PCell change (Intra MN) procedure on the MN (eNB) side

a. Make use of programmable attenuators to simulate varying channel conditions between the Test UE or UE emulator and the MN Source Cell and the Target Cell simultaneously. In this specific case, the MN Source Cell can start off with low attenuation applied which is subsequently increased. At the same time, the Target Cell can start off with high attenuation applied which is subsequently lowered to a level which can trigger the handover from the Source Cell to the Target Cell.

3. Stop data transfer between the Application Test Server and the Test UE or UE emulator

4. Perform data transfer in both directions between the Application Test Server and the Test UE or UE emulator for 10 seconds

Note: it is a requirement for this test case to validate that the user plane transmission operates correctly during Split Bearer(s) operation in EN-DC Option 3x configuration. This involves observing that the user plane data transferred over the X2 in both directions is successfully received by the Test UE or UE emulator (DL data), or by the Application Test Server (UL data) without seeing any packet losses.

One of the methods which can be used to stimulate the Split Bearer(s) usage of both the LTE and NR RATs is to transfer user plane data at data rates which are high enough for the en-gNB to start distributing user plane data to the eNB via the X2 interface.

The exact data rate which is required to be generated is not specified but it is recommended that the data rate is high enough to verify the user plane data transmission (for example, it could correspond to the maximum Layer 1 Radio data rate in both the LTE RAT and NR RAT, which is calculated based on 3GPP TS 36.211 [9], 3GPP TS 38.211 [10] and 3GPP TS 38.214 [11] using the RAN parameters used in this test).

* Data transfer between the Application Test Server and Test UE or UE emulator is possible (via the LTE and NR RATs)

##### 2.2.1.15.4 Procedure

1. Perform data transfer in both directions between the Application Test Server and the Test UE or UE emulator

Note: it is a requirement for this test case to validate that the user plane transmission operates correctly during the PSCell Change using SRB1 for RRC Reconfiguration (full configuration) procedure. This involves observing that the user plane data transferred over the X2 in both directions is successfully received by the Test UE or UE emulator (DL data), or by the Application Test Server (UL data) without seeing any packet losses.

One of the methods which can be used to stimulate the Split Bearer(s) usage of both the LTE and NR RATs is to transfer user plane data at data rates which are high enough for the en-gNB to start distributing user plane data to the eNB via the X2 interface.

The exact data rate which is required to be generated is not specified but it is recommended that the data rate is high enough to verify the user plane data transmission (for example, it could correspond to the maximum Layer 1 Radio data rate in the LTE RAT, which is calculated based on 3GPP TS 36.211 [9] using the RAN parameters used in this test).

2. Perform PSCell Change using SRB1 for RRC Reconfiguration - full configuration option procedure

An example of how this procedure can be performed (or triggered) is listed below. The exact method to perform (or trigger) this procedure is out of scope of this specification and is left up to the implementation of the DUT.

a. The condition by which UE sends an ULInformationTransferMRDC message to the MN depends on the configuration done by MN. Still, we can create a situation where PSCell Change occurs. There should be at least two en-gNB cells within the coverage of a cell under eNB. The first cell under en-gNB which is PSCell and the second cell under en-gNB which is not PSCell. If the tester manually degrades the radio quality of the first en-gNB cell this can be the trigger of the PSCell Change procedure.

One of the possible methods can be to make use of programmable attenuators to simulate varying channel conditions between the Test UE or UE emulator and the first en-gNB cell. In this specific case, the first en-gNB cell can start off with low attenuation applied which is subsequently increased to a level which can trigger the PSCell Change procedure.

3. Stop data transfer between the Application Test Server and the Test UE or UE emulator

4. Perform data transfer in both directions between the Application Test Server and the Test UE or UE emulator for 10 seconds

This involves observing that the user plane data transferred over the X2 in both directions is successfully received by the Test UE or UE emulator (DL data), or by the Application Test Server (UL data) without seeing any packet losses.

One of the methods which can be used to stimulate the Split Bearer(s) usage of both the LTE and NR RATs is to transfer user plane data at data rates which are high enough for the en-gNB to start distributing user plane data to the eNB via the X2 interface.

The exact data rate which is required to be generated is not specified but it is recommended that the data rate is high enough to verify the user plane data transmission (for example, it could correspond to the maximum Layer 1 Radio data rate in the LTE RAT, which is calculated based on 3GPP TS 36.211 [9] using the RAN parameters used in this test).

* Data transfer between the Application Test Server and Test UE or UE emulator is possible (via the LTE and NR RATs)

##### 2.2.1.24.4 Procedure

1. Perform data transfer in both directions between the Application Test Server and the Test UE or UE emulator

Note: it is a requirement for this test case to validate that the user plane transmission operates correctly during the Secondary Node Modification (MN Initiated, Removal of SN terminated split bearer) procedure. This involves observing that the user plane data transferred between the en-gNB to the eNB over the X2 interface during the Secondary Node Modification (MN Initiated, Removal of SN terminated split bearer) procedure can be received successfully by the Test UE or UE emulator without seeing any packet losses.

One of the methods which can be used to stimulate the Split Bearer(s) usage of both the LTE and NR RATs is to transfer user plane data at data rates high enough for the en-gNB to start distributing user plane data to the eNB via the X2 interface.

The exact data rate which is required to be generated is not specified but it is recommended that the data rate is high enough to verify the user plane data transmission (for example, it could correspond to the maximum Layer 1 Radio data rate in both the LTE RAT and NR RAT, which is calculated based on 3GPP TS 36.211 [9], 3GPP TS 38.211 [10] and 3GPP TS 38.214 [11] using the RAN parameters used in this test).

2. Perform Secondary Node Modification with removal of SN terminated split bearer from MN (eNB) side

An example of how this procedure can be performed (or triggered) is listed below. The exact method to perform (or trigger) this procedure is out of scope of this specification and is left up to the implementation of the DUT.

a. Trigger from Core or Core emulator (EPC with EN-DC capabilities) to delete the E-RAB bearer on the established with split bearer for this Test UE or UE emulator

3. Stop data transfer between the Application Test Server and the Test UE or UE emulator

4. Perform data transfer in both directions between the Application Test Server and the Test UE or UE emulator for 10 seconds on the remaining bearer

Note: it is a requirement for this test case to validate that the user plane transmission operates correctly after removal of Split Bearer(s) operation with Secondary Node Modification procedure. This involves observing that the user plane data transferred over the X2 in both directions is successfully received by the Test UE or UE emulator (DL data), or by the Application Test Server (UL data) without seeing any packet losses.

One of the methods which can be used to stimulate the LTE RAT is to transfer user plane data at data rates high enough for the eNB.

The exact data rate which is required to be generated is not specified but it is recommended that the data rate is high enough to verify the user plane downlink data forwarding function (for example, it could correspond to the maximum Layer 1 Radio data rate in the LTE RAT, which is calculated based on 3GPP TS 36.211 [9] using the RAN parameters used in this test).

* Data transfer between the Application Test Server and Test UE or UE emulator is possible (via the LTE and NR RATs)

##### 2.2.1.34.4 Procedure

1. Perform data transfer in both directions between the Application Test Server and the Test UE or UE emulator

Note: it is a requirement for this test case to validate that the user plane transmission operates correctly during the UE measurement transfer procedure. This involves observing that the user plane data transferred over the X2 in both directions is successfully received by the Test UE or UE emulator (DL data), or by the Application Test Server (UL data) without seeing any packet losses.

One of the methods which can be used to stimulate the Split Bearer(s) usage of both the LTE and NR RATs is to transfer user plane data at data rates which are high enough for the en-gNB to start distributing user plane data to the eNB via the X2 interface.

The exact data rate which is required to be generated is not specified but it is recommended that the data rate is high enough to verify the user plane data transmission (for example, it could correspond to the maximum Layer 1 Radio data rate in both the LTE RAT and NR RAT, which is calculated based on 3GPP TS 36.211 [9], 3GPP TS 38.211 [10] and 3GPP TS 38.214 [11] using the RAN parameters used in this test).

2. Perform UE measurement transfer procedure

An example of how this procedure can be performed (or triggered) is listed below. The exact method to perform (or trigger) this procedure is out of scope of this specification and is left up to the implementation of the DUT.

a. The condition by which UE sends an ULInformationTransferMRDC message to the MN depends on the configuration done by MN. Still, we can create a situation where UE measurement transfer occurs. There should be at least two en-gNB cells within the coverage of a cell under eNB. The first cell under en-gNB which is PSCell and the second cell under en-gNB which is not PSCell. If the tester manually degrades the radio quality of the first en-gNB cell this can be the trigger of the UE measurement transfer procedure.

One of the possible methods can be to make use of programmable attenuators to simulate varying channel conditions between the Test UE or UE emulator and the first en-gNB cell. In this specific case, the first en-gNB cell can start off with low attenuation applied which is subsequently increased to a level which can trigger the UE measurement transfer procedure.

3. Stop data transfer between the Application Test Server and the Test UE or UE emulator

4. Perform data transfer in both directions between the Application Test Server and the Test UE or UE emulator for 10 seconds.

Note: it is a requirement for this test case to validate that the user plane transmission operates correctly as a result of successful UE measurement transfer procedure.

The exact data rate which is required to be generated is not specified but it is recommended that the data rate is high enough to verify the user plane data transmission (for example, it could correspond to the maximum Layer 1 Radio data rate in both the LTE RAT and NR RAT, which is calculated based on 3GPP TS 36.211 [9], 3GPP TS 38.211 [10] and 3GPP TS 38.214 [11] using the RAN parameters used in this test).

o All U-Plane data recorded in the S1 logs is correctly received by the Test UE or UE emulator via LTE RAT or NR RAT

o All U-Plane data recorded in the X2 logs (ie, all U-Plane data transferred from en-gNB to eNB) is correctly received by the Test UE or emulated UE via LTE RAT

##### 2.2.1.35.4 Procedure

1. Perform data transfer in both directions between the Application Test Server and the Test UE or UE emulator

Note: it is a requirement for this test case to validate that the user plane downlink data forwarding function operates correctly during the Inter-Master Node Handover procedure.

This involves observing that the user plane data forwarded from the source en-gNB to the target en-gNB, optionally via the source and/or target eNB over the X2 interface during the Inter-Master Node Handover procedure can be received successfully by the Test UE or UE emulator without seeing any packet losses.

The exact data rate which is required to be generated is not specified but it is recommended that the data rate is high enough to verify the user plane downlink data forwarding function (for example, it could correspond to the maximum Layer 1 Radio data rate in both the LTE RAT and NR RAT, which is calculated based on 3GPP TS 36.211 [9], 3GPP TS 38.211 [10] and 3GPP TS 38.214 [11] using the RAN parameters used in this test).

a. The Test UE or UE emulator sends a Measurement Report to the source eNB (S-MN). One of the possible methods can be to make use of programmable attenuators to simulate varying channel conditions between the Test UE or UE emulator and source eNB (S-MN) and the target eNB (T-MN) simultaneously. In this specific case, the source eNB (S-MN) cell can start off with low attenuation applied which is subsequently increased. At the same time, the target eNB (T-MN) cell can start off with high attenuation applied which is subsequently lowered to a level which can trigger the measurement report to be sent to the source eNB (S-MN).

b. The target eNB (T-MN) decides to change the Secondary Node, the target eNB (T-MN) sends the SgNB Addition Request to the target gNB (T-SN).

3. Stop data transfer between the Application Test Server and the Test UE or UE emulator

4. Perform data transfer in both directions between the Application Test Server and the Test UE or UE emulator for 10 seconds

Note: it is a requirement for this test case to validate that the user plane transmission operates correctly during Split Bearer(s) operation in EN-DC Option 3x configuration. This involves observing that the user plane data transferred over the X2 in both directions is successfully received by the Test UE or UE emulator (DL data), or by the Application Test Server (UL data) without seeing any packet losses.

One of the methods which can be used to stimulate the Split Bearer(s) usage of both the LTE and NR RATs is to transfer user plane data at data rates which are high enough for the en-gNB to start distributing user plane data to the eNB via the X2 interface.

The exact data rate which is required to be generated is not specified but it is recommended that the data rate is high enough to verify the user plane data transmission (for example, it could correspond to the maximum Layer 1 Radio data rate in both the LTE RAT and NR RAT, which is calculated based on 3GPP TS 36.211 [9], 3GPP TS 38.211 [10] and 3GPP TS 38.214 [11] using the RAN parameters used in this test).

#### 2.2.2.1 Node behaviour of the corresponding node with RLC-AM and/or RLC-UM

##### 2.2.2.1.1 Test Purpose

The purpose of this test case is to verify that the behaviour of the corresponding node procedure with eNB and en-gNB from different vendors can be successfully completed; conforming to the NR U-Plane profile specification [3] Section 4.1.1.1.

Note: The test cases for the behaviour of the corresponding node sending DDDS when events lost packet detection and stop scheduling for the data bearer occur are included in the chapter 2.2.2.3.

##### 2.2.2.1.2 Minimum Requirements

DUTs: Single eNB and single en-gNB:

Note: In case both RLC-AM and RLC-UM is to be tested, this test case must be executed twice, with respective RLC settings.

* The coverage of eNB cell and en-gNB cell overlap

Testing tools which are required for this test scenario:

* Test UE or UE emulator which is capable of supporting both LTE and NR: used to terminate NAS/AS protocol and data transmission/reception
* Core or Core emulator (EPC with EN-DC capabilities): used to terminate UEs (emulator) NAS protocol
* Application test server: used to originate and terminate application layer traffic (eg, UDP, TWAMP, etc) and provide application layer processing on the network side
* Protocol Analyzer: used to record and observe X2 procedural flows and contents

##### 2.2.2.1.3 Initial Conditions

Refer to Section 2.2 for the standard list of initial conditions.

The following list of initial conditions are applicable for this specific test case:

* EN-DC X2 setup procedure has been successfully completed between the eNB and en-gNB according to the NR C-Plane profile specification [2]
* Test UE or UE emulator has registered to the network, ie, Attach procedure and Service Request procedure specified in 3GPP TS 23.401 [8] has been completed
* Test UE or UE emulator is within the coverage area of the eNB cell and en-gNB cell
* Secondary Node Addition (Option 3x) procedure between the eNB and en-gNB has been successfully completed according to NR C-Plane profile specification [2]
* Data transmission has not been performed via the NR RAT, eg, keeping Option 3x with NR radio quality low enough

Note: This test case is used to verify that the eNB does not discard any of its buffered packets in events such as Radio Link Outage over the LTE RAT unless it receives discard indication from the higher layers or from the en-gNB hosting NR PDCP, such as the buffer discard indication from the en-gNB. This initial condition ensures that en-gNB does not send the buffer discard indication to the eNB.

##### 2.2.2.1.4 Procedure

1. Perform data transfer from the Application Test Server to the Test UE or UE emulator. The Application Test Server generates and transmits downlink data with data size large enough for eNB to buffer the downlink data. The exact data rate that is generated is not specified, but it is up to eNB vendor implementation. It should be noted that this test case does not specify the test data pattern generated by the Application Test Server, but it is recommended that the test data pattern should include some level of randomness (ie, avoiding all zeros).

2. Trigger radio link outage on the LTE RAT.

An example of how this procedure can be performed (or triggered) is listed below. The exact method to perform (or trigger) this procedure is out of scope of this specification and is left up to the implementation of the DUT.

a. To move the Test UE or UE emulator away from the coverage of the eNB. One of the possible methods can be to make use of programmable attenuators to simulate varying channel conditions between the Test UE or UE emulator and the eNB cell. In this specific case, the eNB cell can start off with low attenuation applied which is subsequently increased to a level which can trigger radio link outage condition.

3. Trigger radio link resume on the LTE RAT.

An example of how this procedure can be performed (or triggered) is listed below. The exact method to perform (or trigger) this procedure is out of scope of this specification and is left up to the implementation of the DUT.

a. To move the Test UE or UE emulator back within the coverage of the eNB. One of the possible methods can be to make use of programmable attenuators to simulate varying channel conditions between the Test UE or UE emulator and the eNB cell. In this specific case, the eNB cell can start off with high attenuation applied which is subsequently decreased to a level which can trigger radio link resume condition.

4. Stop data transfer from the Application Test Server to the Test UE or UE emulator.

One of the methods which can be used to stimulate the user plane downlink data forwarding function is to transfer user plane data at data rates which are high enough for the en-gNB to start buffering user plane downlink data prior to the release of the en-gNB.

The exact data rate which is required to be generated is not specified but it is recommended that the data rate is high enough to verify the user plane downlink data forwarding function (for example, it could correspond to the maximum Layer 1 Radio data rate in the LTE RAT and the NR RAT, which is calculated based on 3GPP TS 36.211 [9], 3GPP TS 38.211 [10] and 3GPP TS 38.214 [11] using the RAN parameters used in this test).

2. Perform Secondary Node Release Procedure from MN (eNB) side.

An example of how this procedure can be performed (or triggered) is listed below. The exact method to perform (or trigger) this procedure is out of scope of this specification and is left up to the implementation of the DUT.

a. Provoke a Radio Link Failure in SCG so MN receives SCG Failure Information NR message from the UE. One of the possible methods can be to make use of programmable attenuators to simulate varying channel conditions between the Test UE or UE emulator and the en-gNB cell. In this specific case, the en-gNB cell can start off with low attenuation applied which is subsequently increased to a level which can trigger the Radio link failure scenario.

3. Stop data transfer between the Application Test Server and the Test UE or UE emulator

4. Perform data transfer in both directions between the Application Test Server and the Test UE or UE emulator for 10 seconds

Note: it is a requirement for this test case to validate that the user plane transmission operates correctly as a result of successful Secondary Node Release Procedure in both directions between the Test UE or UE emulator and the Application Test Server.

The exact data rate which is required to be generated is not specified but it is recommended that the data rate is high enough to verify the user plane data transmission (for example, it could correspond to the maximum Layer 1 Radio data rate in the LTE RAT, which is calculated based on 3GPP TS 36.211 [9] using the RAN parameters used in this test).

5. Observe the Protocol Analyzer F1, S1 and X2 logs and Test UE or UE emulator logs.

##### 2.3.1.46.4 Procedure

1. Perform data transfer in both directions between the Application Test Server and the Test UE or UE emulator

Note: it is a requirement for this test case to validate that the user plane downlink data forwarding function operates correctly during the Inter RAT Handover to NR procedure.

This involves observing that the user plane data forwarded from the eNB to the en-gNB, over the X2 interface during the Inter RAT Handover to NR procedure can be received successfully by the Test UE or UE emulator without seeing any packet losses.

The exact data rate which is required to be generated is not specified but it is recommended that the data rate is high enough to verify the user plane downlink data forwarding function (for example, it could correspond to the maximum Layer 1 Radio data rate in both the LTE RAT and NR RAT, which is calculated based on 3GPP TS 36.211 [9], 3GPP TS 38.211 [10] and 3GPP TS 38.214 [11] using the RAN parameters used in this test).

##### 2.3.2.1.4 Procedure

1. Perform data transfer in both directions between the Application Test Server and the Test UE or UE emulator. The Application Test Server generates and transmits downlink data with data size large enough for gNB-DU to buffer the downlink data. The exact data rate that is generated is not specified, but it is up to gNB-DU vendor implementation. It should be noted that this test case does not specify the test data pattern generated by the Application Test Server, but it is recommended that the test data pattern should include some level of randomness (ie, avoiding all zeros).

An example of how this procedure can be performed (or triggered) is listed below. The exact method to perform (or trigger) this procedure is out of scope of this specification and is left up to the implementation of the DUT.

a. To move the Test UE or UE emulator away from the coverage of the gNB. One of the possible methods can be to make use of programmable attenuators to simulate varying channel conditions between the Test UE or UE emulator and the gNB cell. In this specific case, the gNB cell can start off with low attenuation applied which is subsequently increased to a level which can trigger radio link outage condition.

3. Trigger radio link resume on the gNB-DU.

An example of how this procedure can be performed (or triggered) is listed below. The exact method to perform (or trigger) this procedure is out of scope of this specification and is left up to the implementation of the DUT.

a. To move the Test UE or UE emulator back within the coverage of the gNB-DU.

* Test UE or UE emulator is within the coverage area of the source gNB cell
* Test UE or UE emulator has registered to the network, ie, Registration procedure and Service Request procedure specified in the NR C-Plane profile specification [2] has been successfully completed
* Data transfer between the Application Test Server and Test UE or UE emulator is possible

##### 2.4.1.2.4 Procedure

1. Perform data transfer in both directions between the Application Test Server and the Test UE or UE emulator

Note: it is a requirement for this test case to validate that the user plane downlink data forwarding function operates correctly during the Inter gNB Handover procedure. This involves observing that the user plane data forwarded from the source gNB to the target gNB over the Xn interface during the Inter gNB Handover procedure can be received successfully by the Test UE or UE emulator without seeing any packet losses.

One of the methods which can be used to stimulate the user plane downlink data forwarding function is to transfer user plane data at data rates which are high enough for the source gNB to start buffering user plane downlink data prior to the Inter gNB Handover.

The exact data rate which is required to be generated is not specified but it is recommended that the data rate is high enough to verify the user plane downlink data forwarding function (for example, it could correspond to the maximum Layer 1 Radio data rate in the NR RAT, which is calculated based on 3GPP TS 38.211 [10], 3GPP TS 38.214 [11] using the RAN parameters used in this test).

2. Perform Inter gNB Handover Procedure from Source gNB cell to Target gNB cell

An example of how this procedure can be performed (or triggered) is listed below. The exact method to perform (or trigger) this procedure is out of scope of this specification and is left up to the implementation of the DUT.

a. Move the Test UE or UE emulator from the coverage area of source gNB cell towards target gNB cell. One of the possible methods can be to make use of programmable attenuators to simulate varying channel conditions between the Test UE or UE emulator and the source gNB cell and the target gNB cell simultaneously. In this specific case, the source gNB cell can start off with low attenuation applied which is subsequently increased. At the same time, the target gNB cell can start off with high attenuation applied which is subsequently lowered to a level which can trigger the Inter gNB Handover.

3. Stop data transfer between the Application Test Server and the Test UE or UE emulator

4. Perform data transfer in both directions between the Application Test Server and the Test UE or UE emulator for 10 seconds

Note: it is a requirement for this test case to validate that the user plane transmission operates correctly as a result of successful Inter gNB Handover Procedure.

The exact data rate which is required to be generated is not specified but it is recommended that the data rate is high enough to verify the user plane downlink data forwarding function (for example, it could correspond to the maximum Layer 1 Radio data rate in the NR RAT, which is calculated based on 3GPP TS 38.211 [10], 3GPP TS 38.214 [11] using the RAN parameters used in this test).

5. Observe the Protocol Analyzer NG and Xn logs and Test UE or UE emulator logs

##### 2.4.1.2.5 Expected Results and Log Observation

###### 2.4.1.2.5.1 Expected Results

The Inter gNB Handover procedure is successfully completed and data transfer from the Application Test Server to the Test UE or UE emulator and vice versa is ongoing/possible.

###### 2.4.1.2.5.2 Log Observation

o All U-Plane data recorded in the Xn logs (ie, all U-Plane data forwarded from source gNB to target gNB after step 2) is correctly received by the Test UE or UE emulator. No U-Plane data recorded in the Xn in step 4.

* Regarding the downlink U-Plane data generated in step 1 and after step 2 and in step 4:

* Test UE or UE emulator is within the coverage area of MgNB cell and SgNB cell
* Data transfer between the application test server and Test UE or UE emulator is possible

##### 2.4.1.3.4 Procedure

1. Perform data transfer in both directions between the Application Test Server and the Test UE or UE emulator via MgNB

Note: it is a requirement for this test case to validate that the user plane downlink data forwarding function operates correctly during the S-NG-RAN Node Addition procedure. This involves observing that the user plane data forwarded from the MgNB to the SgNB over the Xn interface during the S-NG-RAN Node Addition procedure can be received successfully by the Test UE or UE emulator without seeing any packet losses.

One of the methods which can be used to stimulate the user plane downlink data forwarding function is to transfer user plane data at data rates which are high enough for the MgNB to start buffering user plane downlink data prior to the addition of the SgNB.

The exact data rate which is required to be generated is not specified but it is recommended that the data rate is high enough to verify the user plane downlink data forwarding function (for example, it could correspond to the maximum Layer 1 Radio data rate, which is calculated based on 3GPP TS 38.211 [10] using the RAN parameters used in this test).

2. Perform S-NG-RAN Node Addition procedure

An example of how this procedure can be performed (or triggered) is listed below. The exact method to perform (or trigger) this procedure is out of scope of this specification and is left up to the implementation of the DUT.

a. One of the possible methods can be to make use of programmable attenuators to simulate varying channel conditions between the Test UE or UE emulator and the SgNB cell. In this specific case, the SgNB cell can start off with high attenuation applied which is subsequently lowered to a level which can trigger the S-NG-RAN Node Addition procedure.

3. Stop data transfer between the Application Test Server and the Test UE or UE emulator

4. Perform data transfer in both directions between the Application Test Server and the Test UE or UE emulator for 10 seconds

Note: it is a requirement for this test case to validate that the user plane transmission operates correctly during SN terminated Split Bearer(s) operation in NR-DC. This involves observing that the user plane data transferred over the Xn in both directions is successfully received by the Test UE or UE emulator (DL data), or by the Application Test Server (UL data) without seeing any packet losses.

One of the methods which can be used to stimulate the SN terminated Split Bearer(s) usage of both MgNB and SgNB is to transfer user plane data at data rates high enough for the SgNB to start distributing user plane data to the gNB via the Xn interface.

The exact data rate which is required to be generated is not specified but it is recommended that the data rate is high enough to verify the user plane data transmission (for example, it could correspond to the maximum Layer 1 Radio data rate in both MgNB and SgNB, which is calculated based on 3GPP TS 38.211 [10] and 3GPP TS 38.214 [11] using the RAN parameters used in this test).

5. Observe the Protocol Analyzer NG and Xn logs and Test UE or UE emulator logs

The S-NG-RAN Node Addition procedure is successfully completed.

###### 2.4.1.3.5.2 Log Observation

* "PDU Session Resource Not Admitted List" in "S-NODE ADDITION REQUEST ACKNOWLEDGE"
* "Criticality Diagnostics" in "S-NODE ADDITION REQUEST ACKNOWLEDGE"

the test result shall be determined to be 'successful with remarks'.

Xn and NG logs recorded in the Protocol Analyzer and Test UE or UE emulator logs show that:

* Regarding the downlink U-Plane data generated in step 1 and after step 2:

o All U-Plane data recorded in the NG logs is correctly received by the Test UE or UE emulator via the MgNB or the SgNB

o All U-Plane data recorded in the Xn logs which are:

o Forwarded to the Test UE or UE emulator from the MgNB towards the SgNB via their corresponding established DL Forwarding GTP Tunnels, is correctly received by the Test UE or UE emulator

o Transmitted to the Test UE or UE emulator from the SgNB to the MgNB, via the established MgNB DL GTP Tunnels, is correctly received by the Test UE or UE emulator via MgNB

Note: this test verification process does not impose a requirement for the SgNB to transmit the user plane data which it has received from the MgNB (as part of the downlink data forwarding procedure) to the Test UE or UE emulator via the MgNB, but rather it is to verify the correct operation of the transmit operation via MgNB when it is used by the SgNB.

a. Make use of programmable attenuators to simulate varying channel conditions between the Test UE or UE emulator and the Source PSCell and the Target PSCell in SgNB simultaneously. In this specific case, the Source PSCell can start off with low attenuation applied which is subsequently increased. At the same time, the Target PSCell can start off with high attenuation applied which is subsequently lowered to a level which can trigger the PSCell change.

##### 2.4.1.8.4 Procedure

1. Perform data transfer in both directions between the Application Test Server and the Test UE or UE emulator

Note: it is a requirement for this test case to validate that the user plane downlink data forwarding function operates correctly during the M-NG-RAN node initiated S-NG-RAN node Release with keeping UE procedure. This involves observing that the user plane data forwarded from the SgNB to the MgNB over the Xn interface during the M-NG-RAN node initiated S-NG-RAN node Release with keeping UE procedure can be received successfully by the Test UE or UE emulator without seeing any packet losses.

One of the methods which can be used to stimulate the user plane downlink data forwarding function is to transfer user plane data at data rates high enough for the SgNB to start buffering user plane downlink data prior to the release of the SgNB.

The exact data rate which is required to be generated is not specified but it is recommended that the data rate is high enough to verify the user plane downlink data forwarding function (for example, it could correspond to the maximum Layer 1 Radio data rate in the NR RAT, which is calculated based on 3GPP TS 38.211 [10] and 3GPP TS 38.214 [11] using the RAN parameters used in this test).

a. Provoke a Radio Link Failure in SCG, so MgNB receives SCGFailureInformation message from the UE. One of the possible methods can be to make use of programmable attenuators to simulate varying channel conditions between the Test UE or UE emulator and the SgNB cell. In this specific case, the SgNB cell can start off with low attenuation applied which is subsequently increased to a level which can trigger the Radio link failure scenario.

3. Stop data transfer between the Application Test Server and the Test UE or UE emulator

4. Perform data transfer in both directions between the Application Test Server and the Test UE or UE emulator for 10 seconds

Note: it is a requirement for this test case to validate that the user plane transmission operates correctly as a result of successful M-NG-RAN node initiated S-NG-RAN node Release with keeping UE.

The exact data rate which is required to be generated is not specified but it is recommended that the data rate is high enough to verify the user plane data transmission (for example, it could correspond to the maximum Layer 1 Radio data rate in the NR RAT, which is calculated based on 3GPP TS 38.211 [10] using the RAN parameters used in this test).

One of the methods which can be used to stimulate the user plane downlink data forwarding function is to transfer user plane data at data rates high enough for the SgNB to start buffering user plane downlink data prior to the release of the SgNB.

The exact data rate which is required to be generated is not specified but it is recommended that the data rate is high enough to verify the user plane downlink data forwarding function (for example, it could correspond to the maximum Layer 1 Radio data rate in the NR RAT, which is calculated based on 3GPP TS 38.211 [10] and 3GPP TS 38.214 [11] using the RAN parameters used in this test).

3. Stop data transfer between the Application Test Server and the Test UE or UE emulator

4. Perform data transfer in both directions between the Application Test Server and the Test UE or UE emulator for 10 second.

The exact data rate which is required to be generated is not specified but it is recommended that the data rate is high enough to verify the user plane data transmission (for example, it could correspond to the maximum Layer 1 Radio data rate in the NR RAT, which is calculated based on 3GPP TS 38.211 [10] using the RAN parameters used in this test).

* S-NG-RAN NODE ADDITION procedure between the MgNB and SgNB has been successfully completed according to NR C-Plane profile specification

##### 2.4.1.12.4 Procedure

1. Perform data transfer in both directions between the Application Test Server and the Test UE or UE emulator

Note: it is a requirement for this test case to validate that the user plane downlink data forwarding function operates correctly during the Master Node to gNB Change procedure. This involves observing that the user plane data forwarded from the SgNB to the MgNB over the Xn interface during the Master Node to gNB Change procedure can be received successfully by the Test UE or UE emulator without seeing any packet losses.

One of the methods which can be used to stimulate the user plane downlink data forwarding function is to transfer user plane data at data rates high enough for the SgNB to start buffering user plane downlink data prior to the release of the SgNB.

The exact data rate which is required to be generated is not specified but it is recommended that the data rate is high enough to verify the user plane downlink data forwarding function (for example, it could correspond to the maximum Layer 1 Radio data rate in the NR RAT, which is calculated based on 3GPP TS 38.211 [10] and 3GPP TS 38.214 [11] using the RAN parameters used in this test).

2. Perform the Master Node to gNB Change

A few examples of how this procedure can be performed (or triggered) are listed below. The exact method to perform (or trigger) this procedure is out of scope of this specification and is left up to the implementation of the DUT.

a. The handover to T-gNB is decided by the Master Node based on the Measurement Report sent from the Test UE or UE emulator. One of the possible methods can be to make use of programmable attenuators to simulate varying channel conditions between the Test UE or UE emulator and Master Node cell and the T-gNB cell simultaneously. In this specific case, the Master Node cell can start off with low attenuation applied which is subsequently increased. At the same time, the T-gNB cell can start off with high attenuation applied which is subsequently lowered to a level which can trigger the Master Node to gNB Change procedure.

3. Stop data transfer between the Application Test Server and the Test UE or UE emulator

4. Perform data transfer in both directions between the Application Test Server and the Test UE or UE emulator for 10 seconds

Note: it is a requirement for this test case to validate that the user plane transmission operates correctly as a result of successful Master Node to gNB Change. This involves observing that the user plane data transferred in both directions is successfully received by the Test UE or UE emulator (DL data), or by the Application Test Server (UL data) without seeing any packet losses.

The exact data rate which is required to be generated is not specified but it is recommended that the data rate is high enough to verify the user plane data transmission (for example, it could correspond to the maximum Layer 1 Radio data rate in the NR RAT, which is calculated based on 3GPP TS 38.211 [10] using the RAN parameters used in this test).

This involves observing that the user plane data forwarded from the source en-gNB to the target en-gNB, over the Xn interface during the Inter-Master Node Handover procedure can be received successfully by the Test UE or UE emulator without seeing any packet losses.

One of the methods which can be used to stimulate the user plane downlink data forwarding function is to transfer user plane data at data rates which are high enough for the source en-gNB to start buffering user plane downlink data prior to the change of the en-gNB.

In this specific case, the source gNB (S-MN) cell can start off with low attenuation applied which is subsequently increased.

* Data transfer between the application test server and Test UE or UE emulator is possible (via NR RATs)

##### 2.4.1.17.4 Procedure

1. Perform data transfer in both directions between the Application Test Server and the Test UE or UE emulator.

Note: it is a requirement for this test case to validate that the user plane transmission operates correctly during the UE measurement transfer procedure. This involves observing that the user plane data transferred over the Xn in both directions is successfully received by the Test UE or UE emulator (DL data), or by the Application Test Server (UL data) without seeing any packet losses.

The exact data rate which is required to be generated is not specified but it is recommended that the data rate is high enough to verify the user plane data transmission (for example, it could correspond to the maximum Layer 1 Radio data rate in the NR RAT, which is calculated based on 3GPP TS 38.211 [10] and 3GPP TS 38.214 [11] using the RAN parameters used in this test).

2. Perform UE measurement transfer procedure

An example of how this procedure can be performed (or triggered) is listed below. The exact method to perform (or trigger) this procedure is out of scope of this specification and is left up to the implementation of the DUT.

1. The condition by which UE sends a MeasurementReport message to the MN depends on the configuration done by MN. Still, we can create a situation where UE measurement transfer occurs. There should be at least two SN cells within the coverage of a cell under MN. The first cell under SN which is PSCell and the second cell under SN which is not PSCell. If the tester manually degrades the radio quality of the first SN cell this can be the trigger of the UE measurement transfer procedure.

One of the possible methods can be to make use of programmable attenuators to simulate varying channel conditions between the Test UE or UE emulator and the first SN cell. In this specific case, the first SN cell can start off with low attenuation applied which is subsequently increased to a level which can trigger the UE measurement transfer procedure.

3. Observe the Protocol Analyzer Xn logs and Test UE or UE emulator logs.

##### 2.4.1.18.4 Procedure

1. Perform data transfer in both directions between the Application Test Server and the Test UE or UE emulator.

Note: it is a requirement for this test case to validate that the user plane downlink data forwarding function operates correctly during the Secondary Node Change procedure (MN initiated). This involves observing that the user plane data forwarded from the Source gNB (S-SN) to the Master gNB (MN) and from the Master gNB (MN) to the Target gNB (T-SN) over the Xn interface during the Secondary Node Change procedure (MN initiated) can be received successfully by the Test UE or UE emulator without seeing any packet losses.

One of the methods which can be used to stimulate the user plane downlink data forwarding function is to transfer user plane data at data rates high enough for the Source gNB to start buffering user plane downlink data prior to the release of the Source gNB.

The exact data rate which is required to be generated is not specified but it is recommended that the data rate is high enough to verify the user plane downlink data forwarding function (for example, it could correspond to the maximum Layer 1 Radio data rate in the NR RAT, which is calculated based on 3GPP TS 38.211 [10] and 3GPP TS 38.214 [11] using the RAN parameters used in this test).

1. Move the Test UE or UE emulator from the coverage area of Source gNB cell (S-SN) towards Target gNB cell (T-SN). One of the possible methods can be to make use of programmable attenuators to simulate varying channel conditions between the Test UE or UE emulator and the Source gNB cell (S-SN) and the Target gNB cell (T-SN) simultaneously. In this specific case, the Source gNB cell (S-SN) can start off with low attenuation applied which is subsequently increased. At the same time, the Target gNB cell (T-SN) can start off with high attenuation applied which is subsequently lowered to a level which can trigger the SN change procedure from S-SN to T-SN.

3. Stop data transfer between the Application Test Server and the Test UE or UE emulator.

4. Perform data transfer in both directions between the Application Test Server and the Test UE or UE emulator for 10 seconds.

Note: it is a requirement for this test case to validate that the user plane transmission operates correctly as a result of successful Secondary Node Change procedure (MN initiated). This involves observing that the user plane data transferred in both directions is successfully received by the Test UE or UE emulator (DL data), or by the Application Test Server (UL data) without seeing any packet losses.

The exact data rate which is required to be generated is not specified but it is recommended that the data rate is high enough to verify the user plane data transmission (for example, it could correspond to the maximum Layer 1 Radio data rate in the NR RAT, which is calculated based on 3GPP TS 38.211 [10] using the RAN parameters used in this test).

5. Observe the Protocol Analyzer Xn logs and Test UE or UE emulator logs.

##### 2.4.2.7.5 Expected Results and Log Observation

###### 2.4.2.7.5.1 Expected Results

The use of the *Radio quality assistance information* IE is aligned with the requirement specified in Section 4.1.2.6 of NR U-Plane profile [3].

###### 2.4.2.7.5.2 Log Observation

Xn logs recorded in the Protocol Analyzer are aligned with the NR U-Plane profile specification [3] Section 4.1.2.6 and the following should be observed:

* After step 1, MgNB sends the Assistance Information Data message to SgNB, where the value of *Assistance Information Indication* IE is '0'

Note: the intention is to validate that any configured assistance information is not reported at this moment.

* After step 3, MgNB sends the Assistance Information Data message to SgNB, where *Assistance Information Type* IE, *Number of octets for Radio Quality Assistance Information Fields* IE, and *Radio Quality Assistance Information* IE corresponding to the configured assistance information are included

Note: the intention is to validate that all the configured assistance information is reported.

Note: it is not expected that any assistance information which is not configured to be reported via M-Plane is included in the AID message.

#### 2.4.2.8 DL report NR PDCP PDU SN with RLC-AM

##### 2.4.2.8.1 Test Purpose

The purpose of this test case is to verify that the use of the DL report NR PDCP PDU SN IE with MgNB and SgNB from different vendors can be successfully completed; conforming to the NR U-Plane profile specification [3] Section 4.1.2.7.

##### 2.4.2.8.2 Minimum Requirements

DUTs: Two gNBs (MgNB - MN, SgNB - SN):

* DUTs shall apply RLC-AM specified in NR U-Plane profile specification [3]
* The coverage of MgNB cell (MN) and SgNB cell (SN) overlap each other

Testing tools which are required for this test scenario:

* Test UE or UE emulator which is capable of supporting NR and NR-DC: used to terminate NAS/AS protocol and data transmission/reception
* Core or Core emulator (5GC capabilities): used to terminate UEs (emulator) NAS protocol
* Application test server: used to originate and terminate application layer traffic (eg, UDP, TWAMP, etc) and provide application layer processing on the network side
* Protocol Analyzer: used to record and observe Xn procedural flows and contents

##### 2.4.2.8.3 Initial Conditions

Refer to Section 2.4 for the standard list of initial conditions.

The following list of initial conditions are applicable for this specific test case:

* Xn Setup procedure has been successfully completed between the MgNB and SgNB according to the NR C-Plane profile specification [2]
* Test UE or UE emulator has registered to the network, ie, Registration procedure and Service Request procedure specified in the NR C-Plane profile specification [2] has been successfully completed
* Test UE or UE emulator is within the coverage area of the MgNB cell and SgNB cell
* S-NG-RAN NODE ADDITION procedure between the MgNB and SgNB has been successfully completed according to NR C-Plane profile specification [2]

##### 2.4.2.8.4 Procedure

1. Perform data transfer from the Application Test Server to the Test UE or UE emulator. The Application Test Server generates and transmits downlink data with data size large enough to achieve a sustained data rate over time, to meaningfully verify that the user plane transmission operates correctly.

2. Send the DL User Data message which includes the DL report NR PDCP PDU SN IE from SgNB to MgNB.

3. Observe the Protocol Analyzer Xn logs.

##### 2.4.2.8.5 Expected Results and Log Observation

###### 2.4.2.8.5.1 Expected Results

The use of DL report NR PDCP PDU SN IE is aligned with the requirement specified in Section 4.1.2.7 of NR U-Plane profile specification [3].

###### 2.4.2.8.5.2 Log Observation

Logs Recorded in the Protocol Analyzer show that:

* After beginning of step 2:

o MgNB sends SgNB DDDS including Highest successfully delivered NR PDCP Sequence Number IE with the value same as the value indicated by DL report NR PDCP PDU SN IE.

o MgNB sends SgNB DDDS as soon as possible only when all PDCP PDU SNs up to this DL report NR PDCP PDU have been successfully delivered in-sequence.

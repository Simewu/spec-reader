# Executive summary

The implementation of circular economy transformative model on the telecommunications industry and its network equipment promotes the move to more sustainable business models. It favours both the manufacture of products with eco-design criteria, and the reuse and recycling of these at the end of their useful life. It also contributes to reducing the risk of resource depletion, provides continuity to the supply chain (components, critical raw materials, etc.) and helps reduce GHG emissions.

This document defines circular economy criteria aspects and indicators applicable on network equipment based on the recommendation ITU-T L.1023 (08/2023) "Assessment method for circularity performance scoring", with the intention to reduce environmental impact through the homogenization and prioritization of said criteria based on the network equipment and its impact on the contribution to the circular economy model.

# Introduction

Circular economy model reduces environmental impact supporting the reduction of material use, recycling, and recovering of product, product parts, components, and materials to circulate them in the value chain for as long as possible.

The present document identifies circular economy aspects and indicators applicable on network equipment such as: O-CU, O-DU and O-RU including their respective description, contribution and non-contribution cases to circular economy and priority level according to the effect (for customer, environment etc.) of the indicator at hand.

The objective of this information is to homogenize circularity criteria applicable to network equipment with the aim of reducing its environmental impact during the different phases involved in its life cycle, through improvements that allow achieving the greatest positive effect that contributes to the circular economy in aspects such as: product durability, ability to recycle, repair, reuse, upgrade at equipment level, and finally ability to recycle, repair, reuse, upgrade at manufacturer level. This goal will involve cooperation with stakeholders along the whole of the value chain.

These guidelines are based on the latest recommendation ITU-T L.1023 (08/2023) "Assessment method for

circularity performance scoring". Scoring methodology is out of scope on this document.

A concept that distinguishes between technical and biological cycles, the circular economy is a continuous, positive development cycle. It preserves and enhances natural capital, optimises resource yields, and minimises system risks by managing finite stocks and renewable flows, while reducing waste streams.

# Circular economy on network equipment

Based on ITU-T L.1023 recommendation, there is a three-step methodology to identify an information and communication technology (ICT) good's circularity in three dimensions via three circularity aspects: first, the ICT good durability, second, the ICT good ability to be recycled, repaired, reused and upgraded; and third, the manufacturers ability to recycle, repair, reuse and upgrade the ICT good put into the market. The three asppects are then divided into indicators for circular product design.

In this document the circularity indicators are then assessed at three levels, applicability identification on network equipment (O-CU, O-DU and O-RU), how well circularity has been achieved and priority level according to the effect (for customer, environment etc) of the indicator at hand.

Table 1 - Circularity Aspects - contains a list of circular principles that put all the indicators into different aspects. The description of each aspect is as follows:

1. **Product durability (PD):** It included indicators related to promoting the life span and durability of products by adapting their design and upgrading software to a new version and service support by ensuring the product can be used for as long as possible by the first user or subsequent users.
2. **Ability to recycle, repair, reuse, upgrade (3Rue) - equipment level:** It includes indicators related to the product's structure and access to its priority parts for repair, connecting, systems to facilitate disassembly and reassembly, spare parts, diagnostic and information availability. It relates to:
   1. Possibilities to refurbish the ICT good;
   2. Possibilities to reuse product parts and components within the ICT good (after first use) in refurbishment of similar or other ICT goods;
   3. Facilite the identification, separation and recycling of materials. Addresses separate collection of products for better recycling and development of designated recycling technologies.
3. **Ability to recycle, repair, reuse, upgrade (3Rum) - manufacturer level:** It includes indicators related to the manufacturer ability (on company level) to facilitate recycling, repair, reuse, and upgrade. These requirements are not directly connected to the equipment, but to the infrastructure and support to be developed or supported by the manufacturer. It relates to:
   1. Availability of service support in terms of information, infrastructure, and spare parts.

**Recycle, repair, reuse, upgrade (Manufacturer level)**

In terms of network equipment circularity aspects and indicators and based on the latest publication of ITU- T L.1023 recommendation, two indicators such as: Battery for portable ICT goods and Data security have been excluded on the table above as they are not applicable on network equipment.

In summary, each group contains a set of indicators that directly address the group's topic. The proposed table is in principle unlimited regarding the number of groups and indicators. For example, new indicators for scratch resistance for example for metals, glass, etc. can be added with their respective circularity contribution scenarios. Also new groups can be added accordingly.

Following the second level of assessment of this document, below is described definition and contribution cases to circular economy of each indicator per aspect:

1. **Product durability**
